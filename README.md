# Summary
A command line tool which was originally made to bypass a limit placed on users viewing transaction history of ethereum wallets on etherscan. After viewing too many transactions using the website directly, the user is notified that they must wait for a unspecified period before viewing more transactions. <br> <br>
However, their API allows for 100,000 calls/day, so this tool was built to take advantage of this to make viewing a large number of transactions at once possible.
<br><br>
More features are planned such as profit calculation, and more advanced transaction filtering.
