# Summary
A command line tool which was originally made to bypass a limit placed on users viewing transaction history of ethereum wallets on etherscan. After viewing too many transactions
using the website directly, the user is notified that they must wait for a unspecified period before viewing more transactions. However, their API allows for 1,000,000 calls/day,
so this tool was built to make viewing a large number of transactions at once.
